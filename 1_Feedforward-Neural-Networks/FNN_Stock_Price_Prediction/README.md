# Stock Price Prediction using Feedforward Neural Networks

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a feedforward neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. Feature engineering will be used together with financial formulas to generate more features. The objective is to leverage machine learning and statistics to analyze patterns for the purpose of stock price prediction.

## Project Goals

### 1. Data Preparation

- Preprocessing OHLC and volume
- Engineering additional features such as Moving Averages, Relative Strength Indicators and other technical indicators
- Handle missing values, outliers and normalize data for optimal neural network performance

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Visualize data for trends and patterns between features and target (Price)
- Perform statistical analysis to validate assumptions about data

### 3. Model Development

- Design and implement a feedforward neural network using a Deep Learning framework such as Tensorflow
- Experiment with different network architectures, activation functions and hyperparameters
- Train the model on stock data and engineered features to predict stock prices

### 4. Performance Evaluation

- Measure the accuracy of predictions using MSE and Explained Variance
- Visualize model through loss curves and predicted vs actual stock price

### 5. Deployment and Integration

- Save trained model for future usage
- Explore integration of model to existing application for prediction

### 6. Insights Report

- Analyze key features in prediction of stock price and record them
- Share insights about features and implication on financial strategies
