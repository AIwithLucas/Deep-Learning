## Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)

  - FNNs for classification & regression tasks
  - backpropagation | activation functions | optimization algorithms
  - Credit scoring | Loan defaulting | Stock price movement

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

  - image processing, data visualization, anomaly detection
  - analyze financial charts | detect patterns | classify market movements
  - identify trading signals | spot fraudulent activities | identify irregularities in trends

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

  - suitable for sequential data
  - time-series forecasting | financial trend prediction
  - LSTMs & GRUs to predict stock prices | currency exchange rates | financial market behavior
  - Help business make informed investment decisions & real-time risk assessments

## Transformers

  - Analyzing text data & understanding context
  - BERT | GPT for financial sentiment analysis | news article classification
  - document summarization
